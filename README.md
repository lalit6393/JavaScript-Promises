# Promises
Hey learn JavaScript Promises Here.


# What is Promises
Promises in JavaScript is an object. It evaluates the javaScript operation asynchronously.
It has three states:
Pending: It is the initial state, neither resolved nor rejected.
Resolve: It means that the operation completed successfully.
Reject: It means the operation has failed.
Promises help us deal with asynchronous code in far more simpler way compared to callbacks.
